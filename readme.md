# Diary of the Internet For One Day#

This is a generative short story created using algorithms from [Algorithmia](https://algorithmia.com/) for their [Shorties](https://github.com/algorithmiaio/shorties) contest.

## Texts ##
* [*Big Dummy's Guide To The Internet*](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/118/pg118.txt) by EFF

Why used? To add Internet and technology-related terms.

* [*Leaves of Grass*](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1322/pg1322.txt) by Walt Whitman

Why used? To add a sense of poetic individuality. I also wanted text that could be recognizable)

* [*Daisy: The Autobiography of a Cat*](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/37826/pg37826.txt) by Miranda Eliot Swan

Why used? Mostly, to add a sense of absurdity. I also wanted text that sounded like an autobiography, yet not be tied to a public figure. Also, the Internet is for cats.

* My Twitter Bot, [*@kwakietalkie*](https://www.twitter.com/kwakietalkie), which is a [twitter_ebooks](https://github.com/mispy/twitter_ebooks) bot that uses tweets from my main Twitter account, [*@kwakstop*](https://www.twitter.com/kwakstop)

Why used? To add my own personal touch.

## Packages ##

* [algorithmia](https://www.npmjs.com/package/algorithmia)

* [natural-gutenberg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/natural-gutenberg) to grab *Leaves of Grass* (I simply downloaded the other texts)
