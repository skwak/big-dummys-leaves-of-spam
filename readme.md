# Leaves of Spam #
*The Great American Experimental Story*

## Texts ##

* [*Leaves of Grass*](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1322/pg1322.txt) by Walt Whitman
Why used? It's part of the American canon, with a strong sense of individuality and geography. It's also very recognizable, and I thought that poetry could help emphasize the strange poetic nature of spam.

* *Select Works From My Gmail Spam*
Email spam, as well as the canned precooked meat, are both visually strange amalgamations of American technologies and commerce. I sometimes will read my spam to read the text that gets added in order to bypass spam filters.

## What I used ##
* [Algorithmia](https://www.npmjs.com/package/algorithmia)
    * [Sentence Split](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/StanfordNLP/SentenceSplit)
    * [Generate Paragraph From Trigram](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/lizmrush/GenerateParagraphFromTrigram)
    * [Generate Trigram Frequences](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/ngram/GenerateTrigramFrequencies)
* Node.js and express
* [natural-gutenberg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/natural-gutenberg) to get *Leaves of Grass*

I did not use the [Gmail API](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/nodejs) and instead hand-selected and copied & pasted spam text, but I would use it if I had more time.

## But why? ##
I wanted to enter [Algorithmia](https://algorithmia.com/)'s [Shorties](https://github.com/algorithmiaio/shorties) contest. I also think it's a fun experiment :-)
