This is a generative short story created using algorithms from [Algorithmia](https://algorithmia.com/) for their [Shorties](https://github.com/algorithmiaio/shorties) contest.

## Texts Used ##
* Big Dummy's Guide To The Internet by EFF
(To add technology to the mix)

* Leaves of Grass by Walt Whitman

* My Twitter Bot, [@kwakietalkie](https://www.twitter.com/kwakietalkie), which is a [twitter_ebooks](https://github.com/mispy/twitter_ebooks) bot that uses tweets from my main Twitter account, [@kwakstop](https://www.twitter.com/kwakstop)
(To add my own personal touch)

Packages used:
