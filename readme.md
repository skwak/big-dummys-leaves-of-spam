## What is it? ##
It's a generative short story I made for [Algorithmia](https://algorithmia.com/)'s [Shorties](https://github.com/algorithmiaio/shorties) contest. Creative coding! 

## What I used ##
* [Algorithmia](https://www.npmjs.com/package/algorithmia)
    * [Sentence Split](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/StanfordNLP/SentenceSplit)
    * [Generate Paragraph From Trigram](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/lizmrush/GenerateParagraphFromTrigram)
    * [Generate Trigram Frequences](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/ngram/GenerateTrigramFrequencies)
* Node.js and express
* [natural-gutenberg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/natural-gutenberg) to get *Leaves of Grass*

I did not use the [Gmail API](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/nodejs) and instead hand-selected and copied & pasted spam text, but I would use it if I had more time.

## Texts I used##

* [*Leaves of Grass*](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1322/pg1322.txt) by Walt Whitman

I used this text because it's part of the American canon, with a strong sense of individuality and geography. It's also very recognizable and  thought that poetry could help emphasize the strange poetic nature of spam and political and tech-oriented text.

* *Select Works From My Gmail Spam*

Email spam, as well as the canned precooked meat, are both visually strange amalgamations of American technologies and commerce. I wanted to use spam to represent the dark, commercial side of the Internet.

* [*Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet*](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/118/pg118.txt) by Electronic Frontier Foundation

Serves as sort of balance to all the spam, as well as emphasizes the subject of the Internet as a territory.
