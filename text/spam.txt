Hi there
Louis Williams was living paycheck-to-paycheck and figured it couldn’t get much worse.
And then he lost his job.
“Yeah, my life sucked anyway then that happened. I’m thinking, ‘Come on; gimme a break!”
And Louis’ break came BIG TIME.
He made $764,050 in the first month using this.
In the first month, Jake Pertu’s system earned Williams more than 20 years’ his previous pay.
“I set up your system and the money started coming in later that day, it was like a miracle.”
Ready for your own “miracle?”
Seriously, you can get going with as little
as $250…
Without ANY previous experience…
And in a matter of minutes...
You could be seeing HUGE profits on AUTOPILOT.
There’s nothing to buy and no long-term commitments.

Are Oranges DESTROYING Your Health?
Hey there,
Today I'm angry...
Why?
Well I recently read something that really shocked me...
A recent study by the Journal of the American College of Nutrition shows that many "health foods" no longer contain the vitamins and nutrients that make them "healthy".
In fact, research shows that some fruits and vegetables (like oranges) now contain up to 37% less nutrients than they had 50 years ago.
It's no wonder we're all feeling drained and exhausted all the time... it's because our foods don't contain any nutrients anymore!!!
Now What Can You Do To Reverse This Dangerous Trend?
Fight back.
It's easy, takes less than 30 seconds per day and you can try it for free...
Because my friends at Athletic Greens have created a delicious and organic greens drink that helps your body to absorb more nutrients from the food you already eat...

Weather Machine is a lumino-kinetic bronze sculpture and columnar machine that serves as a weather beacon, displaying a weather prediction each day at noon. Designed and constructed by Omen Design Group Inc., the approximately 30-foot (9 m) tall sculpture was installed in 1988 in the northwest corner of Pioneer Courthouse Square in Portland, Oregon, in the United States. Two thousand people attended its dedication, which was broadcast live nationally from the square by Today weatherman Willard Scott. The machine cost $60,000. During its daily two-minute sequence, which includes a trumpet fanfare, mist, and flashing lights, the machine displays one of three metal symbols as a prediction of the weather for the following 24-hour period: a sun for clear and sunny weather, a blue heron for drizzle and transitional weather, or a dragon and mist for rainy or stormy weather. The sculpture includes two bronze wind scoops and displays the temperature via vertical colored lights along its stem. The air quality index is also displayed by a light system below the stainless steel globe. Weather predictions are made based on information obtained by employees of Pioneer Courthouse Square from the National Weather Service and the Department of Environmental Quality. Considered a tourist attraction, Weather Machine has been called "bizarre",[1] "playful",[2] "unique",[3] and "wacky",[4] and has been compared to a giant scepter.
